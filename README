Here's a theoretical algorithm for implementing the Hangman Game:

    Setup:
        Choose a word to be guessed. This can be done by randomly selecting a word from a predefined list or by letting one player enter a word for another player to guess.
        Determine the number of attempts allowed. This is usually represented by the number of body parts of the hangman (e.g., head, body, arms, legs) or by a fixed number of attempts.

    Display Initial State:
        Show the initial state of the game, which typically includes the hangman structure (initially empty) and the word to be guessed, represented by dashes indicating each letter.

    Game Loop:
        Start a loop where the player can make guesses until the game ends.

    Guessing Mechanism:
        Prompt the player to guess a letter in the word.
        Validate the guess to ensure it's a single letter and hasn't been guessed before.

    Check Guess:
        Check if the guessed letter is present in the word.
            If the letter is correct, reveal its positions in the word.
            If the letter is incorrect, update the hangman structure to show part of the hangman being drawn (if applicable).

    Update Game State:
        Update the state of the game after each guess, including:
            Displaying the hangman structure.
            Showing the updated word with guessed letters filled in.
            Displaying the letters guessed so far.
            Displaying the remaining attempts.
            Indicating whether the game has been won or lost.

    End Game Conditions:
        The game ends when one of the following conditions is met:
            The word is guessed correctly within the allowed attempts.
            The hangman is fully drawn (indicating that the player has run out of attempts).

    Display Outcome:
        Display the outcome of the game, whether the player has won or lost.
        Optionally, reveal the full word if the player loses.

    Play Again Option:
        After the game ends, prompt the player if they want to play again.
            If yes, restart the game with a new word.
            If no, end the program.
